Defending Digital Discourse Developing a Toxic Comment Classifier for Fostering Healthy Online Communities


Here's a step-by-step guide to running this code on any device:
First Run Traning Project on Code

Step 1: Install Required Libraries
If you haven't installed the required libraries, open a terminal or command prompt and type:

pip install tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib numpy opencv-python import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import sys, os, re, csv, codecs, numpy as np, pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Input, LSTM, Embedding, Dropout, Activation
from keras.layers import Bidirectional, GlobalMaxPool1D,Bidirectional
from keras.models import Model
from keras import initializers, regularizers, constraints, optimizers, layers
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
import gensim.models.keyedvectors as word2vec
import gc
import numpy as np

Step 2: Set Up Directory
Ensure you have a directory with images categorized into "with_mask" and "without_mask". Update the DIRECTORY variable in your code to point to this directory:

train = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/naimu/Music/Toxic Comment Classification/Toxic Comment Main Project/Input Dataset/train.csv")
test = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/naimu/Music/Toxic Comment Classification/Toxic Comment Main Project/Input Dataset/test.csv")

Step 3: Run the Code
Copy the entire code and paste it into a Python environment (like Jupyter Notebook or a Python script).

Step 4: Execute the Code
Run the code cell by cell or all at once. This will:

Steps for Defending Digital Discourse Developing a Toxic Comment Classifier for Fostering Healthy Online Communities:
Load images from the specified directory.
Preprocess the images and perform label encoding.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Set up data augmentation.
Build and compile the model.
Train the model.
Evaluate the model's performance.
Save the trained model and generate plots for training loss and accuracy.

Step 5: Check Outputs
After running the code, check the following:

Toxic Comment Classifier
Step 1: Install Required Libraries:
Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. The code requires TensorFlow, NumPy, imutils, and OpenCV (cv2). You can install them via pip:

pip install tensorflow numpy imutils opencv-python

Step 2: Download Model Files:
Download the face detector model files (deploy.prototxt and res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel) from here. Save the downloaded model files in a folder named face_detector.

Step 3: Download Mask Detection Model:

::::
::::

Step 4: Run the Code:
Copy the provided code into a Python environment (e.g., a Python script or a Jupyter Notebook).
Update the paths to the face detector model (prototxtPath and weightsPath) and the face mask detection model (maskNet) in the code.







Sure, here are summaries of four code snippets for different projects:

### Project 1: Toxic Comment Classification

#### Code Snippet 1:
This code snippet performs data visualization and preprocessing for toxic comment classification. It includes visualizing the distribution of toxic labels and cleaning the text data.

#### Code Snippet 2:
It trains logistic regression models for each toxic label using TF-IDF vectorization. The models are evaluated using ROC AUC score, and misclassified examples are analyzed.

#### Code Snippet 3:
The code trains a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier and performs feature analysis to understand the importance of words in predicting toxic comments.

#### Code Snippet 4:
This snippet makes predictions using the trained logistic regression models and provides the probability of comments being toxic for each label.

### Project 2: Spam Email Detection

#### Code Snippet 1:
The code visualizes the distribution of spam and non-spam emails in the dataset and preprocesses the text data by cleaning and standardizing it.

#### Code Snippet 2:
It trains logistic regression models using TF-IDF vectorization for spam classification and evaluates model performance using accuracy and other metrics.

#### Code Snippet 3:
This snippet trains a Naive Bayes classifier and analyzes token frequencies to understand the importance of words in spam detection.

#### Code Snippet 4:
The code makes predictions on new emails using the trained logistic regression models and provides probabilities of emails being spam.

### Project 3: Sentiment Analysis

#### Code Snippet 1:
It visualizes the distribution of sentiment labels in the dataset and preprocesses the text data by cleaning and standardizing it.

#### Code Snippet 2:
The code trains logistic regression models for sentiment classification using TF-IDF vectorization and evaluates model performance using accuracy and other metrics.

#### Code Snippet 3:
This snippet trains a Naive Bayes classifier and analyzes token frequencies to understand the importance of words in sentiment analysis.

#### Code Snippet 4:
The code makes predictions on new text data using the trained logistic regression models and provides probabilities of sentiment labels.

### Project 4: Product Review Rating Prediction

#### Code Snippet 1:
It visualizes the distribution of product review ratings and preprocesses the text data by cleaning and standardizing it.

#### Code Snippet 2:
The code trains regression models for predicting review ratings using TF-IDF vectorization and evaluates model performance using metrics like RMSE.

#### Code Snippet 3:
This snippet trains a Ridge regression model and analyzes token frequencies to understand the importance of words in predicting review ratings.

#### Code Snippet 4:
The code makes predictions on new reviews using the trained regression models and provides predicted review ratings.
