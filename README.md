Defending Digital Discourse Developing a Toxic Comment Classifier for Fostering Healthy Online Communities


Sure, here are summaries of four code snippets for different projects:

### Project 1: Toxic Comment Classification

#### Code Snippet 1:
This code snippet performs data visualization and preprocessing for toxic comment classification. It includes visualizing the distribution of toxic labels and cleaning the text data.

#### Code Snippet 2:
It trains logistic regression models for each toxic label using TF-IDF vectorization. The models are evaluated using ROC AUC score, and misclassified examples are analyzed.

#### Code Snippet 3:
The code trains a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier and performs feature analysis to understand the importance of words in predicting toxic comments.

#### Code Snippet 4:
This snippet makes predictions using the trained logistic regression models and provides the probability of comments being toxic for each label.

### Project 2: Spam Email Detection

#### Code Snippet 1:
The code visualizes the distribution of spam and non-spam emails in the dataset and preprocesses the text data by cleaning and standardizing it.

#### Code Snippet 2:
It trains logistic regression models using TF-IDF vectorization for spam classification and evaluates model performance using accuracy and other metrics.

#### Code Snippet 3:
This snippet trains a Naive Bayes classifier and analyzes token frequencies to understand the importance of words in spam detection.

#### Code Snippet 4:
The code makes predictions on new emails using the trained logistic regression models and provides probabilities of emails being spam.

### Project 3: Sentiment Analysis

#### Code Snippet 1:
It visualizes the distribution of sentiment labels in the dataset and preprocesses the text data by cleaning and standardizing it.

#### Code Snippet 2:
The code trains logistic regression models for sentiment classification using TF-IDF vectorization and evaluates model performance using accuracy and other metrics.

#### Code Snippet 3:
This snippet trains a Naive Bayes classifier and analyzes token frequencies to understand the importance of words in sentiment analysis.

#### Code Snippet 4:
The code makes predictions on new text data using the trained logistic regression models and provides probabilities of sentiment labels.

### Project 4: Product Review Rating Prediction

#### Code Snippet 1:
It visualizes the distribution of product review ratings and preprocesses the text data by cleaning and standardizing it.

#### Code Snippet 2:
The code trains regression models for predicting review ratings using TF-IDF vectorization and evaluates model performance using metrics like RMSE.

#### Code Snippet 3:
This snippet trains a Ridge regression model and analyzes token frequencies to understand the importance of words in predicting review ratings.

#### Code Snippet 4:
The code makes predictions on new reviews using the trained regression models and provides predicted review ratings.

These summaries provide an overview of each project and the key tasks performed in each code snippet. If you need more detailed information or assistance with any specific part, feel free to ask!
